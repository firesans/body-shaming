# BODY-SHAMING CLASSIFIER

Body shaming is an act in which individuals are judged negatively based on their physical appearance.
- Statistics show that nearly 94% of teen girls and 65% of teen boys have been body shamed

## _Aim of this project_: Study and Identify Bodyshaming in Social Media Posts
- Body shaming classifier classifies the input text, mainly Instagram based (both text and hashtags) as body shaming or not, which can be integrated into the framework to weed out toxicity. 

### _Project Results_
- The models were trained on the data that was manually annotated by the team members. 
- We evaluate three machine learning models, *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*, *Random Forest*, and *Logistic Regression (LR)* and also three deep learning models, a vanilla *deep neural net (DNN)*, *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*, *Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)* on their accuracy and precision. 
- We have also incorporated pseudo-labelling into the framework to improve the model accuracy by extra data addition. 
- Their performance was evaluated on the gold standard data provided.
